# SpringBootApplications

After the application started, you are supposed to see file named 'UploadRepo' under 'C:' directory.
This folder will be used to save the content of the uploaded files.

src/main/resources/DownloadRepository: Download API will write the file content here. 

I used RestTemplate for client-side HTTP access. Run the Application.java as Spring Boot Application to run RestTemplate tests.

Future enhancement: 

RestClientTest.java will be filled in to make the same tests in Application.java
ScheduledCronJobs.java will be completed with the related business methods. Template and the annotations are ready.
